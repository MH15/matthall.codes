## Neanderthal
Neanderthal transpiles structured Markdown and Nunjucks content to a static blog, with support for custom pages, tagged posts, and authors. You can write posts in Markdown with front matter metadata, then customize the Nunjucks templates as needed. I designed and implemented this project from scratch to host this site, then published the package for anyone to use.
