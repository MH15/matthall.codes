I've ran this resume through the wringer and figured I'd share what I used to apply to new grad jobs in my senior year of college. The linked resume is anonymized as to provide a starting point for people who may wish to follow the template.

A lot of time and feedback went into this resume style, both from CS peers and industry mentors, so I'd like to think this format definitely won't hurt your job search chances.
